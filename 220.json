Evidently he must show KNOWLEDGE and POWER such as no man has ever been known to possess."},

It is independent of any human witness.\nThe study of these passages necessarily demands supreme human scholarship to interpret— it needs years of intense application. A great deal has still to be worked out. But enough has been discovered to justify his claim; the most sceptical intelligence is compelled to admit its truth.\nThis matter is best studied under the Master Therion, whose years of arduous research have led him to enlightenment.\nOn the other hand, the language of most of the Book is admirably simple, clear and vigorous. No one can read it without being stricken in the very core of his being."},
